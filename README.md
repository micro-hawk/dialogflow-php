- You will be prompted to save the Google Account Credentials JSON file. Save the file as `service-account-file.json` to the dialogflow-php folder.

## usage
-  Create a `config.json`  file with below file contents. 
```json
{
  "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "service-account-file.json",
  "DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_ID": "Dialogflow-session-id",
  "PROJECT_ID": "project-id",
  "BOTNAME": "bot-name"
}
```
- Or Rename `config.example.json` file with `config.json`. Open `config.json` with any text editor and change everything.

1. <b>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</b> : Replace `service-account-file.json` in above json with the [google account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) file name downloaded from gcloud.
> Note :- You should place your [Google Account Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) file, `config json` and `dialogflow.php` in the root dictionary on your server. It's on you to ensure that [google account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) file  and `config.json` file are  not accessible from the web!
2. <b>DIALOGFLOW_SESSION_ID</b> : Replace `Dialogflow-session-id`
3. <b>PROJECT_ID</b> : Replace `project-id` with your project ID.
4. <b>BOTNAME</b> (optional) : Replace `bot-name` with any other name.

- Now create a web server and send a post request.
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/dialogflow.php \
-d '{"sender":"sumith","message":"how are you ?"}'
```
```sh
~$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/dialogflow.php \
-d '{"sender":"sumith","message":"how are you ?"}'

Fulfilment text: I'm great thanks for asking.
```

## Testing
- After creating `config.json` file  create a php server.
```php
php -S localhost:8080
```
- Now open http://localhost:8080 in any web browser.

- Now enter any name in `sender` field and enter any message in `message` field.
- Click send message you will see `fullfilment message`
