<li>To use services provided by Google Cloud, you must create a project. A project organizes all your Google Cloud resources. A project consists of a set of collaborators, enabled APIs (and other resources), monitoring tools, billing information, and authentication and access controls. You can create one project, or you can create multiple projects and use them to organize your Google Cloud resources in a resource hierarchy. When creating a project, take note of the project ID. You will need this ID to make API calls. For more information on projects, see the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects">Resource Manager documentation</a>.</li>
<li><p>In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project,<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard">Go to project selector</a></p>
